# Balanced Parenthesis Sequence Analysis Algorithm

This is a Javascript program to solve the balanced parenthesis string problem using a simple algorithm. Some basic optimizations have been incorporated to check the contents of the string before applying the algorithm. This app took about 45 minutes to build and test.
        
## Balanced Parenthesis Problem Statement:

For any given string expression of size N which contains just opening and closing brackets of the types, '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'. The task is to check if the given expression contains balanced parentheses.

Parentheses are balanced if:
- For every opening bracket, there is a closing bracket of the same type.
- All brackets are closed in the correct order
